      "You look calm and composed — that is professionally strong. Just ensure your voice is carrying the engagement your face is not currently showing. Your tone and pacing need to compensate here.",
      "Neutral reads as professional but on camera it can feel flat to the interviewer. Try a subtle nod when making your strongest point — it signals conviction without being overdone or theatrical.",

    ],

      "Eyebrow raise detected — this can read as uncertainty or being underprepared to an observant interviewer. Take one breath, let your expression settle into calm composure, then begin your answer with a steady, confident opening sentence.",
      "Mild surprise showing on your face. This is a natural reaction when a question lands differently than you expected. Pause briefly, let your expression return to neutral-confident, and then frame your answer clearly and deliberately.",

    low: [
      "Brief surprise expression — very minor and probably invisible to most human interviewers. Just ensure your very next sentence comes out completely steady and confident so there is absolutely no lingering uncertainty visible.",

      "Slight negative expression showing on your face. This may simply be concentration but it reads as displeasure or dismissiveness on camera. Consciously lift your expression — a small nod or slight smile will counteract it immediately and effectively.",
      "Mild closed expression detected. Keep your face deliberately open and inviting when discussing complex or challenging topics — interviewers naturally read facial negativity as a personality and attitude signal, not merely a momentary reaction.",
      "Some expression tightness showing around your mouth or nose area. Quick effective fix: take a breath, slightly raise the corners of your mouth naturally, and your expression will shift to open and professional within seconds.",
    ],
    low: [
      "Very slight expression shift detected. You are almost certainly fine — just stay aware that camera environments significantly amplify even subtle expressions that would go unnoticed in person. Keep your face deliberately open and inviting.",
      "Minor expression cue detected. Probably just deep focus on your answer content. Stay consciously aware of keeping your face inviting and open, especially when answering questions that require careful critical or analytical thinking.",
